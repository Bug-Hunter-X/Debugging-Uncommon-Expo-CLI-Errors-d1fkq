The solution involves a multifaceted approach focusing on correcting inconsistencies within the project's configuration and build process. The most effective method will depend on the nature of the specific error being encountered.  The following strategies offer comprehensive coverage of various common causes:

**1. Correcting `package.json` Errors:**

   Ensure that all dependencies are accurately listed and versions are compatible with each other.  Use `npm install` or `yarn install` to install or update dependencies. Manually verifying the `main` entry point and other file paths ensures correctness.

**2. EAS Build Troubleshooting:**

   If using EAS Build, carefully examine the `eas.json` file for any errors in configuration, particularly file paths or build settings.  Checking EAS Build logs for specific error messages helps pinpoint the problem. Consider performing a simple EAS Build to isolate the issue.

**3. Clearing Cache:**

   Run `expo start --clear` or `expo prebuild --clear` to clear the Expo CLI cache. If needed, clear the entire npm or yarn cache to remove any corrupt cache entries.

**4. Reviewing Recent Project Changes:**

   If recent project modifications preceded the issue, revert those changes one by one to identify the source of the problem. Review the changes carefully for potential conflicts or unexpected side effects.

**5. Verifying Expo SDK Version:**

   Consult the Expo documentation for recommended SDK versions and ensure compatibility with the existing React Native version. Upgrade or downgrade the SDK accordingly.

**Example (Illustrative):**

Let's say `package.json` had a typo in a dependency name:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-natve": "latest"
  }
}
```

The correct form is:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native": "latest"
  }
}
```

After correcting this and running `npm install`, the error would be resolved.
